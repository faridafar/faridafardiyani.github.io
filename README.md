# Community Hub
[on learning purpose] It is my first try to make a Github page and also this page is my first submission for Dicoding online course some time ago. I made a colorful landing page for Community Hub. It still needs some improvement but I'm quite happy with what I created.

Kindly note: the illustrations and icons used on the page are not mine. They are free for personal use that I got from the internet. Some, I got from freepik and I don't remember about the others. I will update this note to credit the creators/platforms.
